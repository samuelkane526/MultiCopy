# MultiCopy
This simple application allows you to use ctrl + b  + (0 through 9) to save highlighted text to a corresponding number. Ctrl + m + (0 through 9) allows you to paste the corresponding text.

# Building the .exe
To build the exe I used gcc. Simply run the following command while in the same dir as the multiCopy.c file. `gcc -o exeName multiCopy.c`.

# Background Process Functionality
After some huge headaches I gave up on creating this as a background process. If anyone wants to make a branch that allows this to run as a background process feel free to add on!
